            Caterpillars have soft bodies that can grow rapidly between moults.
            Their size varies between species and instars (moults) from as small as 1 millimetre up to 14 centimetres.
            Caterpillars have a maximum of 5 pairs of pro-legs. They usually have twelve eyes, six on both sides of their head.
